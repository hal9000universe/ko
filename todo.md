# TODO

- [ ] implement divergences
- [ ] implement construct method for binomial distribution (etc.)
- [ ] create several (possibly different) binomial distributions and sample from them
- [ ] reconstruct binomial distributions and evaluate reconstruction fidelity


# OKAs

- [ ] discern between binomial distributions
- [ ] generalize to continuous distributions
- [ ] understand normal vs. power law distributions
